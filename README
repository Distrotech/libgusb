GUsb is a GObject wrapper for libusb1 that makes it easy to do
asynchronous control, bulk and interrupt transfers with proper
cancellation and integration into a mainloop.
This makes it easy to integrate low level USB transfers with your
high-level application or system daemon.

Not everything you can do in libusb1 is wrapped, although we'll accept
feature requests (with patches) if it makes sense. There is some pretty
low hanging fruit if you're interested.

Note: GUsb is not API or ABI stable at this time, so don't go bitchin'
when we break your compile. That said, we're not going to break API
without a good reason. Caveat emptor.
